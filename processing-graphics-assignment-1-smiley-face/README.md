**[Assignment Standard Operating Procedures](https://mariopineda.github.io/assignment-sops/)**

In this assignment you will start learning how to create graphical output using Processing.

Your final program should produce an image like this. The colours do not have to be the same as long as you have followed all the instructions and changed the default values for colors.

## Step 1
- [ ] Begin with the following code:

```
// Set up canvas
void setup() {
  size(700, 500); // Size of canvas
  background(100, 10, 100); // Background color as rgb values
}

void draw() {
  // Your program will be here...
  
  // Do not forget comments!
}
```
## Step 2 
- [ ] Draw three equally sized rectangles across the screen
- [ ] Line them up evenly (same Y coordinates)
- [ ] Spread them out so they are equally spaced

## Step 3 
- [ ] Label the rectangles with text to match the example
- [ ] Line up the text evenly with the rectangles
* Do not worry about changing the font at this time

## Step 4 
- [ ] Change the stroke, strokeWeight and fill colours for each rectangle
